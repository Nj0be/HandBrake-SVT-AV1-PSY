Snapshot builds are based on the latest development code which means they may or may not be stable and probably won't be documented. As such, your mileage may vary.
These builds are better suited for more experienced users and developers although everyone is welcome to give them a shot and provide feedback.

### Bugs

If you find issues with these builds then post a thorough bug report on our [Issue Tracker!](https://github.com/HandBrake/HandBrake/issues)
Please don't assume we know about your bug or issue. If you see something that isn't working or doesn't make sense, do tell us!
